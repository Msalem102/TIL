# 🧠 Deep Learning: From Theory to Architecture

**Status:** Active | **Current Focus:** Neural Network Geometry & Shallow Networks
**Primary Text:** "Understanding Deep Learning" by Simon J.D. Prince

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my journey into the mathematical foundations and architectural design of Deep Learning. Unlike standard tutorials that focus on high-level APIs, my goal is to understand the "black box" from the inside out.

I am breaking down concepts into:
1.  **Mathematical Derivations:** proving why networks behave the way they do (Calculus/Linear Algebra).
2.  **NumPy Implementations:** building components from scratch to verify the theory.
3.  **Visualizations:** mapping the geometry of high-dimensional decision boundaries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Language:** Python (Strictly typed where possible)
* **Core Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Frameworks:** PyTorch (for architectural implementation later in the roadmap)
* **Environment:** Google Colab & Local Jupyter Notebooks

## 📚 Learning Log (Highlights)
* **Feature Spaces:** Visualizing multivariate inputs and decision boundaries.
* **Activation Functions:** Analyzing ReLU geometry and parameter redundancy (Scale Invariance).
* **Architecture:** Understanding how "regions" are formed by intersection of hyperplanes.
